We also look at some Calvin and Hobbes-inspired fan art (08:49), and crown the Quip Podcast MVP (09:57). Do we mostly just play around with an overpowered water flosser? Yes. But a trophy does change hands at some point.\n\nNext, we break down the incredible post-Super Bowl run that Travis has been on. From dodging projectile beer cans at the Chiefs victory parade (16:50), singing with Jimmy Fallon (23:40), and going live from Studio 8H to host Saturday Night Live (29:30).\n\nTravis answers all the big questions about hosting SNL. What is the week like (31:20), who was the unsung hero of the week (56:00), what was his favorite sketch (01:01:05), and most importantly, what time did he get home from the SNL afterparty? (01:03:50)\n\nFinally, Jason fills us in on what he was up to at the combine (01:15:27), what big-name guests he talked to (01:23:30), and gives us a preview of our incredible interview with Howie Roseman that we will be dropping soon (01:26:30).\n\nAs always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday &amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.\n\n\n\n\nFollow New Heights on Social Media:\n\nhttp://hoo.be/newheightshow\n\nMerch:\n\nhttps://homage.com/newheights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info."

So we try and recap some of our favorites in New News, show off some of the new merch we're dropping to celebrate the occasion (12:10), and look at some of our favorite fan art that you guys sent us over the week (16:15).\n\nThen we get into Championship Sunday starting with the Niners heading to Philly(20:04), Jason's thoughts on the Davonta Smith \"catch,\" (23:25) what the Eagles sideline was really saying after the Brock Purdy injury (30:03), and why you can't chirp back to Eagles fans if you're an opposing player (41:00).\n\nNext, we hit the wildly anticipated Bengals and Chiefs rematch and Travis' thoughts on the newly named \"Burrowhead\" stadium (48:05), why he had to cut a promo on the Mayor of Cincinnati (55:27), what Andy Reid told him on the sidelines after the lateral(01:04:15), how the Chiefs overcame an enormous amount of injuries to clinch the AFC (01:05:56), and our thoughts the roughing the passer call that cost the Bengals the game (01:14:30).\n\nWe hand out some of our final in-season Stamps of the Week to the Chiefs trainers that kept Travis on the field and some Philly fans that couldn't stay on top of a bus stop (01:18:43). We also answer an incredibly not dumb question about the best kind of bowl, trust us it will make sense when you hear it (01:25:56).\n\nFinally, we get to what everyone won't stop talking about, The Kelce Bowl (01:36:19). Jason and Travis share how they really feel being the first brothers to go head to head in a Super Bowl, who is in charge of handing out tickets to the family, and what storylines you should actually be paying attention to before the Super Bowl.\n\nLast, we have some Pod business to fill you guys in on in our new segment \"quick outs.\" We've got some updates on the fanbase name, the ransom we're prepared to offer for the Chad Henne ball, how we need your help with our Reddit page, and the event New Heights will be hosting in Arizona next week (01:48:30).\n\nAs always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday during the NFL season &amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.\n\nKelce Bowl Merch: https://homage.com/newheights\n\n\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info."

Make sure you hit us in the comments below with how you think the guys' rankings hold up.</p><p>As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday during the NFL season &amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.</p><p><br /></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>"

We find out how Travis almost called an insane audible during his biggest play of the game (16:00) and how he really feels about drawing the defense's best cover guy every week (18:13).</p><p>And we look at how \"fly, Eagles fly\" turned into \"run, Eagles run\" on Sunday Night Football (35:48). Jason reveals what he did with the game ball (41:10), and we try to figure out if any records are left for Jalen Hurts to break (44:40).</p><p>Also around the league, we look at the debut of what might be the must-have accessory this Holiday season with Brian Robinson's big hat (51:20) and debate if Darrell Taylor is the best teammate you could want on the sideline (53:15).</p><p>We close with a look ahead to week 13 with the Eagles huge matchup against Derrick Henry and the Titans (01:01:50) and the game Travis might have had circled all season, the Chiefs AFC title game rematch against Joe Burrow and the Bengals (01:04:05).</p><p>As always, thank you for watching and listening to the show send us questions, fan base name suggestions, or anything on your mind to @NewHeightShow or email us at Newheights@gmail.com</p><p>Watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday during the NFL season &amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>"
